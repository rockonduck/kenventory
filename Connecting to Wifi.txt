SSH is available within your kenventory hub for changing wifi credentials,

0. Connect the rhaspberry pi to another computer on the same network switch

0.5. Open terminal command or command prompt and type 
	- ssh -v kenventory@10.0.0.199
	- [ENTER]
	- [RPI Password]
	- [ENTER]

1. Open the supplicant file 

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

2. Add or update your network block at the bottom:


network={
    ssid="YourCustomerSSID"
    psk="TheirPasswordHere"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}


3. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, [ENTER], Ctrl+X).


4. Restart the Wi-Fi service so it picks up the new creds:


sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant@wlan0
sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd


5. Verify you got an IP:


ip addr show wlan0
ping -c3 8.8.8.8


That way—while in kiosk mode on the touchscreen—you can SSH in, update /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf, 
restart networking, and have the Pi join the new Wi-Fi without ever removing the SD card.
